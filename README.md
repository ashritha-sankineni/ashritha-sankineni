# 👋 Hi, I'm Ashritha Sankineni

Senior Data Engineer | Data Quality | Modern Data Platforms | LLM-Enabled Insights

I build **production-inspired data systems** that are scalable, observable, and intelligent.

🔭 I’m currently focused on:
- Data engineering with **Apache Spark**, **Delta Lake**, and **Databricks**
- Building robust **data quality frameworks** (DQ pipelines, observability)
- Integrating **LLM-based explainability** into data workflows
- Modern analytics stacks with **Snowflake** and OLAP optimization

🚀 I’m passionate about:
- Clean architecture across Bronze / Silver / Gold layers
- Turning noisy event systems into trusted analytics
- Democratizing insights with **LLM summaries & narrative explanations**
- End-to-end data ownership — from ingestion through observability

### 💡 Core Skills
**Big Data & Cloud**
- Spark / PySpark | Databricks | Delta Lake
- Snowflake (data modeling, performance tuning)
- Kafka / Event Hubs (streaming concepts)
- Azure Data Factory / orchestration

**Data Quality & Observability**
- Rule-based DQ (missing fields, anomaly detection)
- Metrics, dashboards, drift monitoring
- Systematic isolation of bad data

**AI / LLM Integration**
- LLM-based explainability for data incidents
- Narrative summarization & triage prompts
- Groq / OpenAI-style integration patterns

### 📁 Featured Projects
- **Real-Time Data Quality Monitor** — Enterprise-style DQ pipeline with optional LLM explainability
